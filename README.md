# ApplicantTest_Will

## General Ideas & Develop Progress
I limit the overall time I spent on this project to within 8 hours.

More than half of the time is dedicated to Create this simplified ECS framework.
My main purpose is to show how the data is structured in the project and how the visualize procedure goes.

This simple demo demonstrates a replay system, that includes two modes: normal play,step-by-step. With this simple
ECS framework, we can easily achieve the functions like one frame backward or one frame forward.

Also I didn't introduce any UI runtime updates in this project, because I don't want to just implement some UI callback
events to update the data without a UI framework, this would jeopardize the whole structure of the existing framework.
